Code exercise from SVT to create a Kotlin REST API using spring boot as framework. This project uses gradle as build tool and has a H2 memory databse.

Some example curls for the endpoints: 

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/updatePrograms
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/getPrograms
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/getLatestEpisode/Hundland
